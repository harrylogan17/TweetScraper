# TweetScraper
With this application, you can see about 100 to 350 tweets (depending on the waiting time) of the given username through Selenium, and you can get more clear results searching by date. Data transfer was made through Selenium, not using Api.

You currently have the opportunity to access only the last tweets of the given username or tweets of the given date range. In the future other information about the given username will also be available.

Before you run the program you must specify the path of test browser in Driver.cs and XPath.json file in ParseJson.cs.
